## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT

Artists and their art need more exposure! Everyday, there is a need for the artistic skill sets of all the amazing artists out there, ranging from ad-campaigns, movie posters to website design. 

ARTsY is a platform where people involved in the creative fields get to discover different artists and what they have to offer. 
Your home feed lets you see what your connections have been up to. 
Your explore page lets you discover new artwork. Like what you see? Contact and connect with the original artist to book a commission! Or reblog what you like! This can help your followers find new artwork too. You can view your reblogs and original artwork on your personal blog. 
An artist can also create virtual collections to showcase their pieces. You can group your work based on a theme, event or whichever criterion, and your art collections can be viewed as a group on your profile!

All these features aim to makes it very convenient to freelance deserving artists and for artists to use their blogs as a digital portfolio!

### Approach taken for UI design
---

A minimalist approach is taken to design the app, since the focus is meant to be on the artwork. The different components such as the choice of icons, headers, and overall layout of the app are ensured to be basic and self explanatory, hence easy to use. 
A monochrome colour scheme is opted for the icons and text features, so that the art is more prominent, but different art pieces are chosen for the headers to maintain the artistic theme. 
Grid views are made use of wherever possible, to enhance the art posts. 

Other features include: 
- The welcome , login and sign up pages, aside from serving their respective functionalities, feature artworks uploaded by the user artists. These again promote different kinds of artists. 

- The virtual collection feature, to give the artist the option to organise their work. 

- A chat option, to allow communication between prospective clients.

The easy and minimal layout, along with the features customised to suit artists, make this app an attractive and focused medium to make connections in the art community. 

### Memory management
---

Using the concept of custom Array Adapters and View Recycling we were able to save the memory by reusing the scrap views.
